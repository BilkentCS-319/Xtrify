# Xtrify
Cs 319 Group Project


Xtrify is a web based note-taking application. This application is intended to record the user’s notes and suggest related articles from his/her notes. The intention of developing Xtrify is to feel the lack of such an application since there is no similar note-taking application that serves as a recommendation system at the same time. Different from other note-taking applications, additionally, Xtrify has a recommendation function. Thanks to this function, the system suggests some articles related to the user’s saved note that has been extracted. The user can find some beneficial articles from the suggested list. Also, Xtrify enables the users to intervene to the scope of suggestion. If the user wants to find some specific articles related to her/his note, s/he needs to add or delete the keywords that have been extracted by the system. Since the login is required to use application, the suggested lists are not lost, they are hold in the user’s account, each time the user wants s/he can login and go back to her/his notes and their suggested article lists.
